    "##  Some rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, \n",
    "you may do so, but must justify your choice.\n",
    "2. Make sure you use the `data` folder provided in the repository in read-only mode. (Or alternatively, be sure you \n",
    "don’t change any of the files.)\n",
    "3. Be sure to provide a textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, the solution you \n",
    "implemented, and explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice.\n",
    "4. For questions containing the **/Discuss:/** prefix, answer not with code, but with a textual explanation\n",
    " (**in markdown**).\n",
    "5. Back up any hypotheses and claims with data, since this is an important aspect of the course.\n",
    "6. Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code. Your repo should have a \n",
    "single notebook (plus the required data files) in the *master/main* branch. If there are multiple notebooks present, \n",
    "we will **not grade** anything.\n",
    "7. We will **not run your notebook for you**! Rather, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results \n",
    "contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. \n",
    "Thus, be sure to hand in a **fully-run and evaluated notebook**. In order to check whether everything looks as intended,\n",
    " you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "8. In continuation to the previous point, interactive plots, such as those generated using `plotly`, should be \n",
    "**strictly avoided**!\n",
    "9. Make sure to print results or dataframes that confirm you have properly addressed the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to analyze data from an experiment about *honesty*. \n",
    "Oftentimes, we are asked to confirm our honest intentions by signing **at the end** of a document. \n",
    "For example, in tax returns or insurance policy forms, we are often asked to sign our names under a text that reads \n",
    "something like \"I hereby certify that the above statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when individuals sign **after** lying in the form, they may not feel the need to correct the falsehoods they \n",
    "have reported. In that context, it could be that signing at **the beginning** rather than at the end of the document \n",
    "would decrease dishonesty, as those who are filling the form would be aware of the ethical requirements *before* they \n",
    "provide the information in the form.\n",
    "\n",
    "This intuition has led researchers to partner up with a motorcycle insurance company to run a randomized experiment. \n",
    "In this insurance company (as well as in many others), customers had to report the exact *odometer kilometrage*¹ in \n",
    "order for the company to adjust the insurance premiums. Note that motorcycles with lower kilometrage are less likely to \n",
    "have issues, and thus will result in a lower *insurance premium*². Therefore, customers have an incentive to lie, \n",
    "reporting a kilometrage lower than the real value, in order to save money.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, two different forms were created: one where the signing was done at the end, and another where the \n",
    "signing was done at the beginning. The insurance company then randomized these forms (i.e., each customer received\n",
    " exactly one form, each with probability 50%) and sent back the data that customers had provided. Some noteworthy \n",
    " details on the experiment are that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All customers involved in the experiment already had a contract with the company and were simply renewing it. \n",
    "In the data that the company provided, they also report the odometer kilometrage for their previous contract.\n",
    "Each policy, therefore, contains two contracts: the \"updated\" contract —where the experiment was conducted— and \n",
    "the \"baseline\" contract, which was the previous contract customers had with the company.\n",
    "- A single insurance policy can insure up to 4 distinct motorcycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will take the role of the researcher and work analyzing this data!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Glossary:*\n",
    "1. **odometer kilometrage:** the total distance the motorcycle has traveled.\n",
    "2. **insurance premiums:** the amount of money one pays for an insurance policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The company provided you with a compressed `.tsv` file containing one row per policy. \n",
    "The `.tsv` has the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `condition`: either `Sign Top` or `Sign Bottom`, depending on which form was sent.\n",
    "- `id`: unique identifier for each insurance policy.\n",
    "- `motorcycle_count`: number of motorcycles covered by the insurance policy.\n",
    "- `baseline_motorcycle[1-4]`: odometer kilometrage *reported by the customer* in the *previous (baseline)* contract. \n",
    "- `update_motorcycle[1-4]`: odometer kilometrage *reported by the customer* in the *current (updated)* contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall that a single policy can ensure up to 4 motorcycles, and thus, the suffixes [1-4] indicate that there are 4 \n",
    "versions of these columns in the data (e.g., `baseline_motorcycle1`, `baseline_motorcycle2`, `baseline_motorcycle3`, \n",
    "`baseline_motorcycle4`). \n",
    "- When a policy has fewer than 4 motorcycles, only the columns with the smaller numerals are filled (e.g., if a policy \n",
    "insures one motorcycle,  only `baseline_motorcycle1` and `update_motorcycle1` will be filled).\n",
    "- Note that we only have access to the odometer kilometrage reported by the customers, \n",
    "which may be different from the real kilometrage of the motorcycles."
